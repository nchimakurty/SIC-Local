Description

OUTCOME: This would be the starting point for all other work

OUTCOME: The notebook can just copy the data

OUTCOME: It can be fired off after the data simulator has been created (Try to implement with Table Triggers)

OUTCOME: The data is available in Unity Catalog

OUTCOME: It can handle append(upserts) only data

OUTCOME: Table and Column Names in Snake Case (go with D_BRONZE)

Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN: We are able to simulate changes only data into the EDP

WHEN: Data has been appended to the Bronze table
THEN: The ODS job fires off
AND THEN: The table is only showing active records
AND THEN: The table captures when the data was loaded to the table
AND THEN: The table captures when the data was modified in the table

 

NOTE: Table triggers exist and could be explored
NOTE: A way to test things could be to utilize a simple insert statement.  this could also be used to simulate the simulator.
NOTE: This will probably have some hard coding
